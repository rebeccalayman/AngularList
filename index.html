          <h2>What is Angular?</h2>
          <p>Angular is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and a community 
		  of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in 
		  developing single-page applications. Its goal is to simplify both development and testing of 
		  such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) architecture,
		  along with components commonly used in rich internet applications.
		  <br><br>
		  The library works by first reading the HTML page, which has embedded into it additional custom 
		  tag attributes. Those attributes are interpreted as directives telling Angular to bind input or 
		  output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The 
		  values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from 
		  static or dynamic JSON resources. </p>
         
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>What Elements do I Need to Know?</h2>
          <p>The first element you need to know is a controller. A controller contains the (presentation 
		  or workflow) logic of our Web client. It is written in JavaScript. AngularJS strongly encourages
		  us to separate concerns and put all logic/code into controllers and keep the view (the html page
		  or html fragment) free from any JavaScript. The model on the other hand is a representation of 
		  the data we need to display or change through the user’s input.
		  <br><br>
		  Another important element you need to know something about to understand my project is the json
		  file. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for
		  humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset
		  of the JavaScript Programming Language.</p>
          
       </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>How Were These Elements Used in my Project?</h2>
          <p>The AngularJS application is defined by ng-app. The application runs inside a div tag. The 
		  ng-controller directive names the controller object. The myController function is a standard
		  JavaScript  object constructor. AngularJS will invoke myController with a $scope object. In 
		  AngularJS, $scope is the application object (the owner of application variables and functions). 
		  The myController creates four properties (variables) in the scope (image, author, title and url). 
		  The ng-model directives bind the input fields to the controller properties (image, author, title
		  and url). These variables were obtained through the json file that we were provided to create 
		  this list from.
